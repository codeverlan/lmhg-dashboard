# LMHG Frontend (Minimal)

This minimal frontend uses Next.js + Tailwind CSS. It's a small starter app with a placeholder login page and a couple of reusable components.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies (use pnpm or npm):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Files of interest

- `pages/index.tsx` - home / placeholder
- `pages/login.tsx` - simple login UI
- `components/Button.tsx` - small shared button component

Notes

This is intentionally minimal. After you confirm the layout and auth approach, we can expand this sample with Tailwind utilities, Storybook, and more components.
