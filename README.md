# Louisville Mental Health Dashboard (LMHG)

This workspace contains the OpenSpec and a minimal scaffold for the project:

- `openspec/` - project specifications and planning
- `frontend/` - Next.js + Tailwind minimal scaffold
- `backend/` - FastAPI minimal scaffold with example model and `hipaa_exempt` flag

Next steps

- Review `openspec/project.md` and confirm choices.
- Run the backend and frontend locally to see the minimal scaffold working.
- Request additional features or scaffolding (auth integration, migrations, CI) when ready.
